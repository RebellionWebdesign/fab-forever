### THE HERO SECTION

The hero section has a tagline which speaks directly to interested people. In addition to that there is also a sub tagline which suggests to have a look to the sites content. The CTA button can be used as a visible skiplink to get directly to the content without needing to browse the complete homepage. The main purpose of the website is presented with the hero image of an isometric 3D printer illustration.  

The CTA button can be hovered to change the color slightly.

---

### THE ABOUT SECTION

The about section aims at clearing up what users can read on the website by presenting the main content categories as cards. This information is paired with the text to the left which extends the hero sections tagline by goind a step deeper into the covered topics.

![The about section on desktop](https://github.com/RebellionWebdesign/fab-forever/blob/main/assets/img/fab-forever-about-section.png)

---

### THE TESTIMONIAL SECTION

Website users often need third party validation (social proof) so they can decide if the website is trustable and if it has value to them. Social proof is given by displaying a testimonial from a fictive user who became the CTO of another fictive company.

---

### THE CONTACT SECTION

While browsing the site the user might wants to contact the website owner for whatever reason comes to mind (asking to participate in content writing, asking questions etc.). This gets addressed by asking the user directly if there are questions and by providing a simple contact form.

The form can be filled and "sent off" which results in being directed to a response page which redirects the user back to the homepage after 5 seconds.

![The contact on desktop](https://github.com/RebellionWebdesign/fab-forever/blob/main/assets/img/fab-forever-contact-section.png)

---

### THE FOOTER

The footer has the website logo and states that this website is an educational project. On the right side the user can find social link icons which will send visitors to the respective platform displayed on the icons.

The footer is fully responsive and collapses to the centered social icons only on mobiles.

---

### THE CONTENT PAGES

The content pages have the same design overall, so the basics page is an example. Content pages feature large images on desktop. On mobile they collapse to smaller versions of the images.

![Example content page](https://github.com/RebellionWebdesign/fab-forever/blob/main/assets/img/fab-forever-content.png)

---

### THE RESPONSE PAGE

The user gets redirected to the response page if the form is filled out and the button clicked. It congrats the user and says thanks for reaching out. After 5 seconds it redirects the user to the homepage.

## DESIGN

### COLOR SCHEME

The chosen color scheme consists of the following colors:

![color scheme](https://github.com/RebellionWebdesign/fab-forever/blob/main/assets/img/fab-forever-color-scheme.png)

- Purple and purple accent colors were chosen because it combines the energy of red and the stability/trustworthyness of blue

- Blue was chosen because it represents trustworthyness and stability, also it looks superb with purple in a gradient

- Black and white were chosen for contrast

### TYPOGHRAPHY
The font for the headings used is Montserrat (Google Fonts) regular, accompanied by Montserrat Extra Bold which is used to give emphasis to the first word of the headings.  

![montserrat 400](https://github.com/RebellionWebdesign/fab-forever/blob/main/assets/img/fab-forever-montserrat-regular.png)

![montserrat 800](https://github.com/RebellionWebdesign/fab-forever/blob/main/assets/img/fab-forever-montserrat-extra.png)

For the body text the font Poppins (also Google) was used. It is a clean sans serif font which means it improves readability.

![poppins 400](https://github.com/RebellionWebdesign/fab-forever/blob/main/assets/img/fab-forever-poppins-regular.png)

In terms of design both fonts work together very well, as they are both clean and pleasing to the eye.
